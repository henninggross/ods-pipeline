# Admin Installation Guide

This guide will show how to install `ods-pipeline` in an existing ODS cluster. Note this is a one-time installation done by a cluster admin and does not need to be repeated for every project that wants to use `ods-pipeline`.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

* A namespace in an OpenShift cluster (such as `ods`)
* `git` and `oc`
* to be logged into OpenShift on the command line as a cluster admin

## Instructions

1. Run `make install-ods-central namespace=ods`
2. If you want to make use of Aqua, change the `ods-buildah` BuildConfig to include a build arg:

```
spec:
  strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      buildArgs:
        - name: aquasecScannerUrl
          value: >-
            https://username:password@download.aquasec.com/scanner/5.3.0/scannercli 
```

Make sure that username/password are URL-encoded and that the `scannercli` version matches your Aqua server version.

4. Run `make start-ods-central-builds`
