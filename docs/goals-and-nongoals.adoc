= Goals and Non-Goals

== Scope

A pipeline that fulfills the needs for BI X but has EDP in mind (meaning it is clear how to extend the prototype to fulfill EDP needs in the future).

== Goals

* Compatible with project concept (*-cd, *-dev, *-test)
* Compatible with quickstarter concept (e.g. one repo per component)
* Support for TypeScript (Node), Java 11, Go, Python
* Deployment to OpenShift via Helm
* Deployment to external cluster (copy image, apply resources)
* Allow to bundle multiple repos together like the RM does
* Allow to work monorepo-style (not at all costs though)
* SonarQube scanning (with code insight report to Bitbucket)
* Aqua scanning (with code insight report to Bitbucket)
* Setting build status in Bitbucket
* Do not commit into the repo for which the pipeline runs
* Testing of tasks in isolation (e.g. in GitHub Actions)
* Easy to develop (e.g. images can be build locally, etc.)
* Have the "RM" only collect artefacts that have been built already (gain speed, simplicity)

== Non-Goals

* Integration with Jira
* Integration with existing DocGen service
* Support for exporting resources from DEV
* Support of Tailor (or not if next gen of Quickstarters are developed with Helm)
* Provisioning of projects and quickstarters (could be done via Tekton in the future though)
* Deployment to AWS etc.
* Notification of Teams channel on build status
* Merge back into main branch (do that via Bitbucket buil-in features instead)
