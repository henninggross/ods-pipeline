# Debug Mode

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Allow pipeline users to understand what is going on when a task fails.
This might not be easy if the default log output is not chatty.

## Decision

Add a new `ConfigMap` which allows to configure properties of the `ods-pipeline` installation in the users namespace. For now this `ConfigMap` only has one property to enable/disable debugging.

## Consequences

Compared to `ods-jenkins-shared-library`, which allows to enable/disable debugging via the `Jenkinsfile`, using a `ConfigMap` makes it easier to switch debugging on as it does not require a Git commit. The downside is that it is not traced in Git whether debugging is on or not. Further, the debugging mode now applies to all pipelines instead of just those from one repository. This looks like an acceptable trade-off compared to managing multiple toggles.

Each ODS provided task should read the `debug` key in the `ConfigMap` and be more chatty as a result.
