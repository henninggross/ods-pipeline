= ods-build-gradle

Builds Java Gradle applications.

Tests exclude the vendor directory. Test results are converted into xUnit format.

Both xUnit report and coverage report are placed into .ods/artifacts.

Note on build environment variables available:
- `ODS_OUTPUT_DIR`: this environment variable points to the folder
that this build expects generated application artifacts to be copied to.
The project gradle script should read this env var to copy all the
generated application artifacts.
- `NEXUS_* env vars`: following env vars `NEXUS_HOST`, `NEXUS_USER` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD`
are available and should be read by your gradle script.

The following steps are executed:
- build and test execution (using `./gradlew clean build`)
- SonarQube quality scan

To copy the generated application artifact e.g within the project gradle script follow this steps:
- read the env var `ODS_OUTPUT_DIR` in the buildscript section of the gradle script:
buildscript {
    ext {
      outputDir = System.getenv('ODS_OUTPUT_DIR')
      }
}
- customize the jar tasks to set the destination directory
jar {
    println("Set application jar name to 'app'")
    archiveBaseName = 'app'
    if (outputDir != null) {
        println("Set destinationDirectory to '${projectDir}/${outputDir}'")
        destinationDirectory = file("${projectDir}/${outputDir}")
    }
}

To create a coverage report be sure that you add to `gradle.properties` the required
configuration. E.g for enabling Jacoco you will need to:
- add `jacoco` plugin
- add task `jacocoTestReport`:
    jacocoTestReport {
        reports {
          xml.enabled true
        }
    }
- add `finalizedBy jacocoTestReport` to the task `test`:
    tasks.named('test') {
        // Use JUnit Platform for unit tests.
        useJUnitPlatform()
        finalizedBy jacocoTestReport
    }

After tests ran successfully, the application source code is scanned by SonarQube.

To configure SonarQube be sure to include the property file `sonar-project.properties`
to define following required properties. Here an example with default values:
- sonar.sources=src
- sonar.java.binaries=build/classes
- sonar.junit.reportPaths=build/test-results/test
- sonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths=build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml
Otherwise the SonarQube scan will fail.

When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. Pull request decoration
in Bitbucket is done automatically by SonarQube provided the ALM integration is setup
properly in SonarQube.


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| working-dir
| .
| Working directory. The path must be relative to the root of the repository,
without leading `./` and trailing `/`.



| gradle-additional-tasks
| 
| Additional gradle tasks to be passed to the gradle build. (default tasks called are `clean` and `build`).


| gradle-options
| 
| Options to be passed to the gradle build. (See ref: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_debugging)


| output-dir
| docker
| Path to the directory into which the resulting Java application jar should be copied, relative to `working-dir`. This directory may then later be used as Docker context for example.


| sonar-quality-gate
| false
| Whether the SonarQube quality gate needs to pass for the task to succeed.


| sonar-skip
| false
| Whether to skip SonarQube analysis or not.
