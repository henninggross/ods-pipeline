= ods-build-python-with-sidecar

Builds Python applications.

When `sonar-quality-gate` is set to `true`, the task will fail if the quality gate
is not passed. If SonarQube is not desired, it can be disabled via `sonar-skip`.
The SonarQube scan will include parameters to perform a pull request analysis if
there is an open pull request for the branch being built. If the
link:https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/bitbucket-integration/[ALM integration]
is setup properly, pull request decoration in Bitbucket is done automatically.

**Sidecar variant!** Use this task if you need to run a container next to the build task.
For example, this could be used to run a database to allow for integration tests.
The sidecar image to must be supplied via `sidecar-image`.
Apart from the sidecar, the task is an exact copy of `ods-build-python`.
