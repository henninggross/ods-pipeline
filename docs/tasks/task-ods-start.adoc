= ods-start

Starts the pipeline run.

This task will clone a repo from the provided url into the workspace, and
sets the build status of the checked out commit in Bitbucket to "in progress".

If the checked out repositories' `ods.yml` file defines subrepos, those will
be checked out as well into `.ods/repos`. Subrepos will be checked out at
the branch specified in `ods.yml` or `master` if no branch is given.
However, if a version (e.g. `1.0.0`) is passed to the pipeline, then
subrepos are checked out at a corresponding release branch (e.g.
`release/1.0.0`) if it exists.

Any artifacts in Nexus for the checked out Git commits are downloaded and
placed into `.ods/artifacts`. When subrepos are configured, a successful
pipeline run must exist for each subrepo for the pipeline to continue. If no
such run artifact exists, the pipeline will stop. Users will need to re-run
the pipeline of the subrepo first before running the pipeline of the
umbrella repo again.

*This task is automatically added to any pipeline run as the first task
by the webhook interceptor and cannot be customized by users at this point.*
