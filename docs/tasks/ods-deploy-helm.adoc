= ods-deploy-helm

Deploy Helm charts.

This tasks will install / upgrade a Helm chart into your Kubernetes /
OpenShift cluster using Helm.

Helm has the plugins `helm-diff` and `helm-secrets` installed. A diff is performed
before an upgrade is attempted. `helm-secrets` can be used to encrypt sensitive
values in the underlying Git repository. Secrets are decrypted on the fly if the secret
identified by the `age-key-secret` parameter exists, and contains an age secret key
which public key was used as one of the recipients to encrypt. The age-key file location
is known via `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` environment variable (e.g.: `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=/sops/age/keys.txt`)

Based on the target environment, some values files are added automatically to the
invocation of the `helm` command if they are present in the chart directory:

- `values.yaml`: the values file (automatically considered by Helm).
- `secrets.yaml`: a secrets file.
- `values.<STAGE>.yaml`: a values file named after the stage (`dev`, `qa` or `prod`) of the target environment.
- `secrets.<STAGE>.yaml`: a secrets file named after the stage (`dev`, `qa` or `prod`) of the target environment.
- `values.<ENVIRONMENT>.yaml`: a values file named after the name of the target environment.
- `secrets.<ENVIRONMENT>.yaml`: a secrets file named after the name of the target environment.

Further, the task adds a `values.generated.yaml` file. This values file
contains only one value, `gitCommitSha`, which contains the Git commit SHA being built. It is
provided by the task as this value cannot be known by value file authors in advance. Use this
value to set e.g. the image tags in `Deployment` resources, like this: ``.

Before the Helm chart is applied, it is packaged, setting the `appVersion` to the Git commit SHA
and the `version` to the externally provided version, if any. If `version` is not given, the value
in `Chart.yaml` is used as-is.

If the pipeline runs for a repository defining subrepos in its `ods.y(a)ml` file, then any charts in
those subrepos are packaged as well, and added as dependencies to the top-most chart under `charts/`.
Note that values and secrets files are only collected from the repository for which the pipeline runs.
This means that if you use an umbrella repository to promote an application from a `dev` stage to `qa`
and `prod`, the umbrella repository needs to define the stage/environment specific values for
the subcomponents  for `qa`/`prod` instead of having those files in the subrepo.


== Parameters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Parameter | Default | Description

| chart-dir
| ./chart
| Helm chart directory that will be deployed


| release-name
| 
| The Helm release name. If empty, the release name is simply the name of the chart.


| age-key-secret
| helm-secrets-age-key
| Name of the secret containing the age key to use for helm-secrets.
If the secret exists, it is expected to have a field named `key.txt` with the age secret key in its content.



| age-key-secret-path
| /sops/age
| Age key secret file path where `age-key-secret` secret will be mounted.
Helm secrets will know `key.txt` file location via `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` environment variable.
