# User Installation Guide

This guide will show how to install `ods-pipeline` in an existing ODS project. It is possible to use the new Tekton pipelines approach and the classic Jenkins approach side by side.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

* A namespace in an OpenShift cluster (such as `foo-cd`) and a project in Bitbucket (such as `FOO`)
* `git`, `oc` and `helm` installed locally
* to be logged into OpenShift on the command line

## Instructions

1. Create a repository in Bitbucket, e.g. `foo-cd`. The name can be anything, but since the repository will define the resources in namespace `foo-cd` in code, it makes sense to mirror the namespace name.
2. Clone the repository locally and make an initial commit.
3. Use `git subtree` to get the required sources. The following commands may look a bit complicated, but in a nutshell, they are simply adding one folder (`deploy/cd-namespace`) from the `opendestack/ods-pipeline` repository at the given revision (`master`) into your new local repository at the path `cd-namespace`. The steps can be repeated in the future with other revisions to update the sources.

```
pipelineGitRef=master
git fetch --depth=1 https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-pipeline.git $pipelineGitRef:ods-pipeline-$pipelineGitRef
git checkout ods-pipeline-$pipelineGitRef
git subtree split --squash --prefix=deploy/cd-namespace -b subtree-split-branch
git checkout -
git subtree add --prefix=cd-namespace subtree-split-branch
```

4. Change to the new folder `cd-namespace`.
5. Add a `values.foo-cd.yaml` file and fill in the variables. The values expected for those variables are explained in `chart/values.yaml`.
6. Run `./install.sh -n foo-cd -f values.foo-cd.yaml`.
7. Run `oc -n foo-cd expose svc el-ods-pipeline` to expose the service listener. Make a note of the exposed URL.

Now your cd namespace is fully setup and you can start to utilize Tekton pipelines for your repositories.

## Using ods-pipeline in your repos

Add an `ods.yml` into each repo you want to add. Example:
```
branchToEnvironmentMapping:
- branch: master
  environment: dev

environments:
- name: dev
  namespace: foo-dev

pipeline:
  tasks:
  - name: backend-build-go
    taskRef:
      kind: ClusterTask
      name: ods-build-go-v0-1-0
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace
  - name: backend-build-image
    taskRef:
      kind: ClusterTask
      name: ods-build-image-v0-1-0
    runAfter:
    - backend-build-go
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace
  - name: backend-deploy
    taskRef:
      kind: ClusterTask
      name: ods-deploy-helm-v0-1-0
    runAfter:
    - backend-build-image
    workspaces:
    - name: source
      workspace: shared-workspace
```

In Bitbucket, add a webhook pointing to the exposed route. The secret must match
the one you entered in the values file.

The next push in that repo will trigger the pipeline.
