= Development & Running tests

First, check if your system meets the prerequisites:
```
make check-system
```

Then, launch a KinD cluster, install Tekton, build&push images and run services:
```
make prepare-local-env
```

Finally, run the tests:
```
make test
```

More fine-grained make targets are available, see:
```
make help
```
